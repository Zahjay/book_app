## What is Z-Readz?

### Z-Readz is a simple web application built for the voracious reader who wants a web app that is strictly designed to keep a book lover happy. It gives them an  easy way to explore different categories of books, create a user account, and to keep track of books that they have read and want to read. We believe that by giving voracious readeres the option to access a site that is tailored toward them, we will achieve a high rate of user interaction. 


## General Approach 
### To begin this project I came up with wireframes and tables in order to have an end goal to work towards. Since I am doing a fullstack crud application, achieving crud fuctionality first was the main goal. (Styling - Bootstraps-Sass) was worked on in segments throughout the entire project. During the initial stages of this project making lists helped me to stay organized, and daily checkins with instructional staff kept me on track.

# Wireframes

## Wireframs for Tables 


##### Below is the Book table it contains six different categories three of which were added once the table was built.

## Technologies Used / Dependencies:
### Various Gems / Resources

- gem 'devise', '~> 4.3'
- gem 'paperclip', '~> 5.0.0'
- gem 'simple_form', '~> 3.5'
- gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3', '>= 3.3.7'
-  realtimeboard for wireframes 
-  I read a lot of different blog post and documentation on making auth work with rails this definitely helped to see how consditional styling works. 




## Direction for Future Growth/ Future Stages of Development 

- Add a section where users can differenciate the books that they have read, want to read, and don't want to read.

- Pulling book info from an API

- More work with Bootstrap-Sass grid system

- Adding a table where users can critique a book.

- Adding a section where users can upload there photos.
