# Z-Readz

## What is Z-Readz?

### Z-Readz is a simple web application built for the voracious reader who wants a web app that is strictly designed to keep a book lover happy. It gives them an  easy way to explore different categories of books, create a user account, and to keep track of books that they have read and want to read. We believe that by giving voracious readeres the option to access a site that is tailored toward them, we will achieve a high rate of user interaction. 


## General Approach 
### To begin this project I came up with wireframes and tables in order to have an end goal to work towards. Since I am doing a fullstack crud application, achieving crud fuctionality first was the main goal. (Styling - Bootstraps-Sass) was worked on in segments throughout the entire project. During the initial stages of this project making lists helped me to stay organized, and daily checkins with instructional staff kept me on track.
